### QR Code Generator
QR generator application in Python using the QRCode library and Streamlit to create a web application.
## Technologies used
- Code Editor: Visual Studio Code;
- Programming Language: Python;
- Python Libraries:
	- QRCODE: Library used to generate the QR Codes
	- streamlit: To create the webpage

## Functionality
The structure consists of a web application in which we insert a web link and it returns a QR code that we can download.
##Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to install and set up the project on your machine:

#1.- Clone this repository
**Download the source code using git clone or by downloading the ZIP file from GitHub:
	git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
	cd your_repository

#2.- Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
**It's recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts. You can set it up with the following commands:

	python -m venv venv
	source venv/bin/activate      # On Linux/Mac
	venv\Scripts\activate         # On Windows

#3.- Install the required dependencies
**To run the project, you'll need to install the following Python libraries:

- streamlit: For building the web interface.
- qrcode: For generating QR codes.

You have three options to install the dependencies:

**Option 1: Install all dependencies at once from requirements.txt**
If you have a requirements.txt file, use the following command to install all dependencies:

	pip install -r requirements.txt

**Option 2: Install all dependencies manually at once**
Use the following command to install both libraries:

	pip install streamlit qrcode

**Option 3: Install dependencies manually**
Alternatively, you can install each library individually:

	pip install streamlit
	pip install qrcode

Any of these methods will ensure the necessary libraries are installed.

#4.- Create the required folders
**Ensure that the necessary folders exist in your project directory:

	mkdir -p qr_codes images

#5.- Add the icon (qricon.png)
**Place an image file named qricon.png in the images folder. This will be used as the icon in the application. If you donâ€™t have an image, you can either remove or modify this functionality in the code.

#6.-Run the application
**Start the Streamlit server to view the application:

	streamlit run your_script_name.py

Replace your_script_name.py with the name of the file containing the code. In this case is: QRgen.py

	streamlit run QRgen.py
